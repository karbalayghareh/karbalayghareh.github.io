We propose a Bayesian transfer learning framework, in the homogeneous transfer learning scenario, where the source and target domains are related through the joint prior density of the model parameters. The modeling of joint prior densities enables better understanding of the ‚Äútransferability‚Äù between domains. We define a joint Wishart distribution for the precision matrices of the Gaussian feature-label distributions in the source and target domains to act like a bridge that transfers the useful information of the source domain to help classification in the target domain by improving the target posteriors. Using several theorems in multivariate statistics, the posteriors and posterior predictive densities are derived in closed forms with hypergeometric functions of matrix argument, leading to our novel closed-form and fast Optimal Bayesian Transfer Learning (OBTL) classifier.

We propose a Bayesian transfer learning framework, in the homogeneous transfer learning scenario, where the source and target domains are related through the joint prior density of the model parameters. The modeling of joint prior densities enables better understanding of the ‚Äútransferability‚Äù between domains. We define a joint Wishart distribution for the precision matrices of the Gaussian feature-label distributions in the source and target domains to act like a bridge that transfers the useful information of the source domain to help classification in the target domain by improving the target posteriors.

After observing Gaussian expression values of n genes at m consecutive time points, with consideration of missing data, an algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM) is proposed to estimate the parameters and infer the unknown parts of the networks in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense. Then the estimated values are plugged in to the Bayes classifier, which is optimal, and the performance of the classifier is investigated through various simulations.","tags":null,"title":"Classification of Gaussian trajectories with missing data in Boolean gene regulatory networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
