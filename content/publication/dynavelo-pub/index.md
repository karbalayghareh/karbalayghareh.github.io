abstract: We present DynaVelo, a generative neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that learns the joint dynamics of gene expression and transcription factor (TF) motif activities in evolving cell systems using single-cell multiome data. DynaVelo leverages partial RNA velocity information together with single-cell TF motif accessibility data to improve the modeling of cell state dynamics and identification of TF drivers. We show that DynaVelo recovers the complex and bifurcating in vivo dynamics of wildtype murine germinal center (GC) B cells and reveals how these cell dynamics change under loss-of-function mutations in epigenetic regulators.
