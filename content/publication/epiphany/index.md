abstract: Predicting chromatin contact maps from 1D epigenomic signals remains a challenging problem in computational biology. Here we present Epiphany, a deep learning method that predicts Hi-C contact maps from 1D epigenomic signals using a novel architecture that combines convolutional and attention mechanisms to capture both local and long-range interactions in chromatin organization.
